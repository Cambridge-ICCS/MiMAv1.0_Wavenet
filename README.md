# Model of an idealized Moist Atmosphere (MiMA) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/36012278.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/36012278)
MiMA is an intermediate-complexity General Circulation Model with interactive water vapor and full radiation. It is published in

[M Jucker and EP Gerber, 2017: *Untangling the annual cycle of the tropical tropopause layer with an idealized moist model*, Journal of Climate 30, 7339-7358](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0127.1)

Please see the documentation [online](http://mjucker.github.io/MiMA/) or [in the docs folder](docs/) for information about the model.
